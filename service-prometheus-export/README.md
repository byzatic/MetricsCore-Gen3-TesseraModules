# Prometheus Export Service

This service is a pluggable component for the Tessera system that exports data to Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints.

## Purpose
`PrometheusExportService` is responsible for converting runtime data from Tessera workflows into Prometheus metrics. These metrics can then be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring and visualization purposes.

The service enables automated export of workflow results, such as processed metrics or intermediate data values, without requiring additional custom exporters.

## Key Responsibilities
- Read and interpret runtime parameters to identify what data should be exported.
- Transform the selected data into Prometheus metrics (counters, gauges, etc.).
- Register metrics with a Prometheus HTTP exporter, enabling external scraping.

## Main Components

### `PrometheusExportService`
This is the main service class.

**Responsibilities:**
- Extract relevant `DataItem` values passed into the service.
- Match these values to expected metric definitions.
- Convert them to Prometheus metrics using a built-in registry.
- Provide updated metrics to be exposed through the standard Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint.

### `PrometheusExportServiceFactory`
A lightweight factory class used by Tessera to instantiate `PrometheusExportService`.

**Purpose:**
- Register the service in the plugin system.
- Provide metadata such as service ID and description.
- Enable dynamic loading of this service inside a workflow routine.

## Integration
This service is not part of the DAG execution graph. Instead, it runs independently and is managed by the service control subsystem within the Tessera engine.
It continuously observes and exports metrics derived from workflow activity and internal service state, making them available for Prometheus-based monitoring solutions.

This module is intended to operate within the Tessera orchestration engine and is not a standalone Prometheus exporter.
